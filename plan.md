# Recipe Buddy Development Plan

## Project Overview
Recipe Buddy is a web application that analyzes photos of ingredients and suggests possible recipes. This document outlines the development process, including learning resources and implementation steps.

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have:
- Python 3.10+ installed
- Basic understanding of Python
- Git installed and GitHub account
- VS Code or PyCharm
- Basic command line knowledge
- OpenAI API key ($5 free credit)

## Phase 1: Setup and Learning (2-3 days)

### 1.1 Development Environment
1. Create project directory and virtual environment:
```bash
mkdir recipe-buddy
cd recipe-buddy
python -m venv venv
# On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
# On Unix: source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install initial dependencies:
```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn python-multipart python-dotenv openai pytest
```

3. Create initial project structure:
```
recipe-buddy/
├── backend/
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── main.py
│   │   ├── models.py
│   │   └── routers/
│   ├── tests/
│   └── requirements.txt
├── frontend/
└── README.md
```

### 1.2 Learning Resources
Study these topics (use AI to help understand concepts):

1. FastAPI Fundamentals (1 day)
- Complete FastAPI tutorial at https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/
- Focus on: Path operations, Query parameters, Request body, Response model

2. OpenAI API (1 day)
- Study OpenAI API documentation
- Focus on: GPT-4 Vision API, completion parameters, error handling
- Practice with simple examples

## Phase 2: Backend Development (4-5 days)

### 2.1 Core API Structure
1. Set up FastAPI application structure
2. Implement basic health check endpoint
3. Set up environment variables
4. Create base models using Pydantic

### 2.2 Image Analysis Service
1. Implement image upload endpoint
2. Create OpenAI service for ingredient detection
3. Build prompt engineering system
4. Implement error handling and validation

### 2.3 Recipe Generation Service
1. Design recipe data model
2. Implement recipe generation using GPT-4
3. Create filtering system for dietary restrictions
4. Add caching for common requests

### 2.4 Testing
1. Write unit tests for core functions
2. Implement integration tests
3. Set up GitHub Actions for CI

## Phase 3: Frontend Development (4-5 days)

### 3.1 React Setup
1. Create new React project:
```bash
npx create-react-app frontend
cd frontend
npm install axios @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```

2. Set up project structure:
```
frontend/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── services/
│   ├── hooks/
│   └── utils/
```

### 3.2 Core Components
1. Implement image upload component
2. Create recipe display component
3. Add loading states and error handling
4. Implement basic styling

### 3.3 User Interface
1. Design and implement main page layout
2. Add responsive design
3. Implement error messages and loading indicators
4. Add basic animations

## Phase 4: Integration and Polish (2-3 days)

### 4.1 Integration
1. Connect frontend to backend
2. Test full application flow
3. Implement error boundary
4. Add logging

### 4.2 Documentation
1. Write API documentation
2. Create README with setup instructions
3. Add code comments
4. Create example usage guide

### 4.3 Final Testing
1. End-to-end testing
2. Performance testing
3. Mobile responsiveness testing
4. Security review

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Image Processing
- Start with small, clear images
- Implement size and format validation
- Use compression if needed

### Challenge 2: API Costs
- Implement caching
- Use smaller models for development
- Set up usage monitoring

### Challenge 3: Recipe Quality
- Refine prompts iteratively
- Add validation for recipe structure
- Implement feedback mechanism

## Extension Ideas
1. User accounts and recipe saving
2. Sharing functionality
3. Dietary restriction profiles
4. Shopping list generation
5. Meal planning feature

## Tips for AI Assistance
When using AI to help with development:
1. Always ask for explanations of generated code
2. Request tests alongside implementation
3. Ask for best practices and common pitfalls
4. Use AI to help debug issues
5. Ask for code reviews

## Key Learning Objectives
- FastAPI application structure
- React component design
- API integration
- Prompt engineering
- Error handling
- Testing strategies
- Documentation best practices

## Success Metrics
Your MVP should:
1. Successfully analyze food images
2. Generate coherent recipes
3. Handle errors gracefully
4. Load efficiently
5. Be easy to set up locally
